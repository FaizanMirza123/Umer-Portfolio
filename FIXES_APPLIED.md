# Portfolio Website - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Dark Theme Styling for Experience Section

**Problem**: The experience section had hardcoded `text-black` classes that didn't work with dark theme.

**Solution**: Updated all text color classes to use proper dark mode variants:

- `text-black-900` â†’ `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- `text-black-700` â†’ `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300`
- `text-black-500` â†’ `text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`
- Added dark mode variants for background colors and borders

**Files Changed**:

- `frontend/src/components/Experiences.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`

### 2. âœ… Admin Dashboard Edit Functionality

**Problem**: Couldn't edit existing projects and experiences in the admin dashboard.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive edit forms for existing items:

- Added edit mode detection for individual items
- Created inline edit forms that appear when clicking edit button
- Proper data loading and saving for existing items
- Edit forms include all fields (title, description, image, URLs, technologies/skills)

**Files Changed**:

- `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx`

### 3. âœ… Admin Routing and View Site Button

**Problem**:

- View Site button reloaded admin dashboard
- No dedicated `/admin` URL
- Admin was always redirected to dashboard

**Solution**: Implemented proper React Router setup:

- Added routing with `/admin` and `/admin-login` routes
- Fixed View Site button to open portfolio in new tab
- Admins can now freely navigate between admin and public site
- Proper route protection and redirects

**Files Changed**:

- `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Added BrowserRouter
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Implemented routing logic
- `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Fixed View Site button

### 4. âœ… Database Schema Updates

**Problem**: Database might be missing recent schema changes.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive migration scripts:

- Auto-detects missing tables and columns
- Adds proper timestamps and data types
- Creates default settings if none exist
- Works with conda base environment

**Files Created**:

- `backend/migrations/migrate_v1_to_v2.py` - Main migration script
- `backend/run_migration.bat` - Windows batch script
- `backend/run_migration.sh` - Linux/Mac bash script
- `backend/migrations/README.md` - Migration documentation

## How to Run the Migration

### For Windows Users:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run migration script
run_migration.bat
```

### For Linux/Mac Users:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Make script executable
chmod +x run_migration.sh
